				<div class="about_content">
			<p>I knew there was a necessity in having a local bakery/baker that could provide people gluten free baked items. So I called my grandmother and she gave me some cake recipes that I transformed into vegan and/or gluten free recipes. I went online and looked for a name (I don't know how I came up with that name,'THE PASTRY SHOP' but I thought it sounded cute). I created my own website on my laptop and took a couple of pictures of the cupcakes I was baking.</p>
			<p>I remember the first time when I baked something and asked my parents to taste it. Their reaction gave me the confidence that I can do it. So, I delivered my first oder. The appreciation was beyond my imagination. Now, I have done 600+ deliveries of my baked products and I have realized that this is what I would like to do for the rest of my lifetime.</p>

        			<h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
        			<p>Our mission is to serve people with the most authentic, delicious and yet healthy baked items. Nowadays, the main reason for people to fall sick is because of the food that they eat. But, here we come with our fresh, vegan cakes, cupcakes, donuts, etc, which will not only keep you healthy but also will surely suffice your cravings. Our main aim is to keep our customers healthy and that we are ensuring completely.</p>
        			<p>We don't use any peanuts or artificial sugar etc which are highly responsible for the declining condition of people's health. That is the reason why most of our customers are fitness freaks as well as a foodie too, because we don't let them compromise either with their body or with their sweet tooth.</p>

        			<h3>OUR VISION</h3>
        			<p>Our vision complements with our mission. When we started the business, our goal was to provide good food to the customers. Good food not only means tasty but also fresh and healthy, so that they don't have to compromise with their health in anyway and hence we chose to open a VEGAN bakery shop.</p>
        			 <p>Opting for a vegan bakery in itself was a tough nut to crack. We had to learn special recipes, spend nights to have a complete grip on them, try out different combinations to develop a better taste, etc. But the result of all the hardwork paid off really well. The amount of love and good responses that we got is beyond anything. That is what kept us going till now. And we hope that the support will continue forever and we promise to deliver the best cakes forever. </p>
